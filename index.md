#### See: [How to make your own Rabi-Ribi Maps](https://wcko87.github.io/rabiribi-map-editing/)

The Rabi-Ribi map editor comes from the [Rabi-Ribi Speedrunning Community](http://www.speedrun.com/rabiribi).

If you have a custom map, send it to me and I'll list it here.

Some custom maps also have speedrunning leaderboards. You can also send runs to me or post it on the speedrunning discord (with video) and I'll add it to the leaderboard. Please try to overlay a timer over the video if you do a run.

# How to play Custom Rabi-Ribi Maps

There are two methods.
### Method 1: Version 1.8e
The [1.8e beta version](https://steamcommunity.com/app/400910/discussions/0/1473095965300641483/) includes special features specifically to support Rabi-Ribi custom maps.

### Method 2: Replacing maps
This was the original method before the 1.8e beta started supprting custom maps.
1. Replace the maps in `Rabi-Ribi\data\area\` (remember to back up the maps before you do this)
2. Start up Rabi-Ribi and start a new game normally.

Note: Even if you do not back up your maps, you can easily restore your original maps by using the Verify Game Integrity option on steam.
