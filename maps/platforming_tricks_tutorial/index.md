# Description

This is a comprehensive tutorial for Rabi-Ribi platforming tricks and glitches.

It contains most of the tricks we use in Rabi-Ribi. (rough estimate: around 80+ tricks are featured in this tutorial) Tricks are classified into Basic, Intermediate and Advanced. The objective is to collect all the eggs in the map.

NPCs around the map will explain the tricks and how to execute them.

The map starts you off in a room with three doors. These doors correspond to:
* **Basic Section (1 Star)** - 5 Eggs
* **Intermediate Section (2 Stars)** - 31 Eggs
* **Advanced Section (3 Stars)** - 13 Eggs

Total: 49 Eggs

### Instructions:
* Play on Story Mode.
  - difficulty / mode does not matter
  - You can play on Speedrun Mode too, but you can't talk to NPCs in Speedrun Mode.
