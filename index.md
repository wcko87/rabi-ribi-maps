# Rabi-Ribi Custom Maps

#### See: [How to make your own Rabi-Ribi Maps](https://wcko87.github.io/rabiribi-map-editing/)

The Rabi-Ribi map editor comes from the [Rabi-Ribi Speedrunning Community](http://www.speedrun.com/rabiribi).

If you have a custom map, send it to me and I'll list it here.

Some custom maps also have speedrunning leaderboards. You can also send runs to me or post it on the speedrunning discord (with video) and I'll add it to the leaderboard. Please try to overlay a timer over the video if you do a run.

# How to play Custom Rabi-Ribi Maps

There are two methods.
### Method 1: Version 1.8e / 1.85 onwards
The 1.8e beta version includes special features specifically to support Rabi-Ribi custom maps. This also works from 1.85 onwards.
1. Add the custom map files to `Rabi-Ribi\custom\<your map name>`. (each custom map should be in its own folder)
2. After starting Rabi-Ribi, press F5 or F6 to open up the [custom maps menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27341392/30108930-ee520480-9336-11e7-9a82-bf40ca1ae89e.png). Select the custom map and start a new game. 

### Method 2: Replacing maps
This was the original method before the 1.8e beta / 1.85 started supprting custom maps.
1. Replace the maps in `Rabi-Ribi\data\area\` (remember to back up the maps before you do this)
2. Start up Rabi-Ribi and start a new game normally.

Note: Even if you do not back up your maps, you can easily restore your original maps by using the Verify Game Integrity option on steam.
