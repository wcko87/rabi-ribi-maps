# Description

This is a comprehensive tutorial for Rabi-Ribi platforming tricks and glitches.

It contains most of the tricks we use in Rabi-Ribi (rough estimate: around 80+ tricks are featured in this tutorial). Tricks are classified into Basic, Intermediate and Advanced. NPCs around the map will explain the tricks and how to execute them.

Note: This map contains only platforming tricks. It does not include combat or boss-related tricks.

The objective is to collect all the eggs in the map.

The map starts you off in a room with three doors. These doors correspond to:
* **Basic Section (1 Star)** - 5 Eggs
* **Intermediate Section (2 Stars)** - 31 Eggs
* **Advanced Section (3 Stars)** - 13 Eggs

**Total:** 49 Eggs

### Instructions:
* Play on **Story Mode**.
  - difficulty / mode does not matter
  - You can play on Speedrun Mode too, but you can't talk to NPCs in Speedrun Mode.
