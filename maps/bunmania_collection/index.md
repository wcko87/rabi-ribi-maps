# What is Bunmania?

Bunmania is a Rabi-Ribi game mode. Bunmania works very well for racing short custom maps.

- The level instantly restarts when you complete it. Or press Menu + Item + Magic Left for instant level restart.

- Bluerock is a short and easy map, and does not require knowledge of Rabi-Ribi platforming tricks to play.

## Bunny Chase (v1.02)
#### by Red Shifter
![bunny_chase](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27341392/53293773-ac6ffd80-3815-11e9-9a0a-0ff00a96cdc7.jpg)

![bunny_tunnel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27341392/53293774-ac6ffd80-3815-11e9-9a9a-4f9f7a03b694.png)

- A very fast paced map which doesn't stop you when you fail jumps
- Most rooms have basic (slower) and advanced (faster) methods to do them. clearing the map requires only basic tricks, but achieving a good time requires you to perform a lot of advanced jumps
- Failing to nail an advanced jump doesn't really require you to retry, you just revert to the basic method and take the timeloss
- Rainbow time is 3 minutes, and it will be very difficult to get.

--------------------------

## Bunny Ruins (v1.02)
#### by TheOnlyOne
![bunnyruins](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27341392/53293775-ad089400-3815-11e9-8be7-152ed911b409.jpg)

- 5 hidden Easter Eggs

--------------------------

## Drag Racing
#### by wcko87

- One long flat surface, just pure speed
- No advanced tricks required. literally hold right (and jump like 3 times maybe) to win
- Rainbow is set to 45s, bronze is 55s

- Erina had too many sweets and got a cavity! Go see the dentist then come home for a nice nap.

## Legend DX (v1.00)
#### by Red Shifter
![legend_dx](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27341392/53293777-ad089400-3815-11e9-8494-ca8ec5e1a7b9.png)

- Based on "Legend of Bunny", this map contains a variety of environments and areas from it
- This is a Bunmania map (rather than a Metroidvania adventure)
- No advanced techniques required

#### by Koslyn
![loopy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27341392/53293778-ada12a80-3815-11e9-844c-9c0f40fd5b52.png)

- Erina jumps through the park then visits the same room 3 times before finding the exit
- Can be beaten with just rwj and wallkicks but requires more advanced tricks to get good times

--------------------------

## Magic Powder
#### by wcko87
![magic_powder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27341392/53293779-ada12a80-3815-11e9-9b34-1b623f04b806.png)

- Simple 1 minute map involving slide jumps
- Venture deep into the forest, grab the sliding powder, and climb back out
- No other tricks needed, just slide jumps (and maybe launches for speed)
- No zips. all possible zips are useless

--------------------------

#### by wcko87
![needlemania](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27341392/53293780-ada12a80-3815-11e9-9dff-97994b0c423e.png)

- A short needle map (lots of spikes), lots of retrying
- But being a bunmania race map, each section is pretty short (2-3 quick jumps usually)
- The distance in between saves is short so that times will not fluctuate wildly due to deaths
- No advanced tech required. just airjump, reverse walljump, wallkick

--------------------------

## Pitfall (bunmania edit)
#### by wcko87
![pitfall](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27341392/53293781-ae39c100-3815-11e9-89ba-7bc013787ce0.png)

- Intended for Bunmania
- Can be completed with no tricks whatsoever (difficulty 1)

#### by Sanghelios
![sora](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27341392/53293784-aed25780-3815-11e9-9f67-7b2523193a1f.png)

[MISSING IMAGE]

- A map set in the sky, you hop on clouds and floating platforms/ships. No tech of any kind required, not even hidden tech. Still tricky sometimes though.
- It's a Bunmania map with an objective; drop from your ship and get to the enemy ship to disable it
- I originally wanted strong winds to be the challenge in the cloud section, but that's DLC only. So I added cute bunny girls instead, you can never go wrong with cute bunny girls.

--------------------------

## ZipZipZip
#### by wcko87
![zipzipzip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27341392/53293785-aed25780-3815-11e9-83e2-185bdfba74c5.png)

- Bunny is like a box of hundo, you never know what zip you're gonna get
- 20 assorted zips
- No advanced tricks to clear, you have a time limit for each zip, if the time runs out, the door opens and you can continue
- You need to get at least one zip for bronze (5m 30s bronze), if you don't do any zips and wait out all the timers, it takes about 6 minutes.
