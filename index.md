# Rabi-Ribi Map Editor

The Rabi-Ribi map editor comes from the [Rabi-Ribi Speedrunning Community](http://www.speedrun.com/rabiribi).

The map editor will be put up publicly at some point in the future. For for now, if you want to try making your own maps, look for me (wcko87) on either [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wcko87), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/wcko87), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/wcko87) or in the [Rabi-Ribi Speedrunning Discord](https://discord.gg/dDfpNAr).

If you have a custom map, send it to me and I'll list it here.

Some custom maps also have speedrunning leaderboards. You can also send runs to me or post it on the speedrunning discord (with video) and I'll add it to the leaderboard. Please try to overlay a timer over the video if you do a run.
