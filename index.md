# Rabi-Ribi Custom Maps

#### Update: The Rabi-Ribi Steam workshop has been set up. We recommend going to the steam workshop to get the latest versions of the maps. Speedrun leaderboards will continue to be maintained on this website.
- [**Rabi-Ribi Steam Workshop - Standard Maps**](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=400910&requiredtags[]=Map+-+Standard)
- [**Rabi-Ribi Steam Workshop - Bun Race Maps**](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=400910&requiredtags[]=Map+-+Bun+Race)

If you have a custom map, send it to me and I'll list it here.

Some custom maps also have speedrunning leaderboards. You can also send runs to me or post it on the speedrunning discord (with video) and I'll add it to the leaderboard. Please try to overlay a timer over the video if you do a run.
