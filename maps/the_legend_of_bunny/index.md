## Description
Cicini has been designing some kind of game inside the computer. She had been talking about it to everyone for a while, but she eventually stopped hanging out with people as often.

One day, Syaro calls Erina over to the Computer Room. Cicini doesn't seem to be anywhere in sight...

This is a stand-alone Bunnytroidvania adventure where Erina journeys into the computer to save Cicini from her video game addiction. 

## Notes
- Contains a generic plot with stupid video game references and a bunch of NPCs telling you where to go
- It's on the harder side but should almost be reasonable on ~~Normal~~ Novice difficulty (can be changed in-game)
- Variety of areas to explore
- Lots of items to pick up
- Bakery
- ~~Crappy~~ Postgame
- No DLC required
- Easter Egg hunt
