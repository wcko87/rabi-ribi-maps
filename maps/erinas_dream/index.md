# Description
Erina has a dream involving some people she knows and some places she's been to.

A somewhat short map utilizing various 1.8e features, such as story editing and adding items.

# Notes
* Level design is on the easier side, so the map is fairly accessible.
* Intended difficulty level is Normal/Standard. Higher difficulties will absolutely not be pleasant, lower difficulties will be relaxing.
* Almost all items have a second event in them that gives you another item, fully enter the tile to make sure you get them.
* Movement items can be skipped if you don't care about the secondary stat ups they contain.
* There are no intended double bosses, if you run into one then reload your save. That should be fixed now, though.
* Some cutscene-related movement may be erratic and up to chance due to the events used. I apologize for any inconvenience.
